	<h4>Allow me to introduce myself.</h4>

With a passion for writing and science, I decided to pursue a major in Professional Writing and minor in Environmental Studies and hoping to bridge the two areas through research and science writing. When I'm not writing you can find me biking, running, or reading outside. I enjoy being active and am constantly trying new things and picking up new hobbies. I want to travel around the world and immerse myself in different cultures and traditions as I travel. My family and friends are most important to me, especiall my dog, Frances. </strong> </p>
