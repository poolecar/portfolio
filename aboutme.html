	<h2>"If you have other things in your life--family, friends, good productive day work--these can interact with your writing and the sum will be all the richer." </h2>

	<h4>Allow me to introduce myself.</h4>
	<p id="introduction"> <strong>I was born into a family of Spartans and knew from the moment I went to my first football game I wanted to call Michigan State my home. With a passion for writing and science, I decided to pursue a major in Professional Writing and minor in Environmental Studies and hope to bridge the two areas through research and science writing. When I'm not writing you can find me biking, running, or reading outside. I enjoy being active and am constantly trying new things and picking up new hobbies. I want to travel around the world and immerse myself in different cultures and traditions as I travel. My family and friends are most important to me, especiall my dog, Frances. </strong> </p>
