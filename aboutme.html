	<p>I was born into a family of Spartans and knew from the moment I went to my first football game I wanted to call Michigan State my home. With a passion for writing and science, I decided to pursue a major in Professional Writing and minor in Environmental Studies and hoping to bridge the two areas through research and science writing.</p>
